    Deployment failure was observed when repository files are present, but the
    ctlplane is a non routed network. The node cannot connect to repositories
    before the network is configured in this case. The tripleo-bootstrap role
    uses the ansible built-in ``package`` which fail despite the fact that the
    packages are already installed in case it cannot connect to repositories.

    The tripleo-bootstrap role will now inspect the installed packages to
    check wheater or not packages are already installed. When packages are
    installed, the ``package`` tasks are skipped. See bug:
    `1959731 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1959731>`_.
