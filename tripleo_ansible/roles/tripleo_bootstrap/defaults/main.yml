# List of packages that are required for legacy networking to function.
# NOTE: We are using 'network' service provided by 'network-scripts' (initscripts)
#       which deprecated in recent releases but os-net-config doesn't support yet
#       NetworkManager. Until it happens, we need to ensure that network is started
#       at boot, as it'll take care of restarting the network interfaces managed by
#       OVS. Note that OVS unit service is already configure to start before
#       network.service.
