# Note: a tripleo-ansible container has three systemd files associated with it:
#  1. tripleo_*.service - the regular systemd service generated by tripleo-ansible
#  2. libpod-conmon*.scope - created dynamically by podman. runs a conmon
#     process that creates a pidfile for tripleo_*.service and monitor it.
#  3. libpod-*.scope - created dynamically by runc. for cgroups accounting
#
# tripleo-ansible can only set start/stop dependencies on 1., not 2. and 3.
# On reboot, systemd is allowed to stop 2. or 3. at any time, which can
# cause 1. to stop before its deps as set up by tripleo-ansible.
#
# To prevent an unexpected stop of 1. from happening, inject a dependency
# in 2. and 3. so that systemd is forbidden to stop those scopes
# automatically until tripleo-container-shutdown.service is stopped.
# That way, when systemd stops 1., the two scopes 2. and 3. will
# finish in sequence and tripleo-ansible dependencies will be respected.
