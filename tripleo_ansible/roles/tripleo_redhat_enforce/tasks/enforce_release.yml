      for the Overcloud you need to add a new parameter file to your deploy
      command with that parameter set.
      If this is unexpected, you have to subscribe this node and
      ensure that RHEL is pinned to {{ tripleo_redhat_enforce_os }} as
      this is the only version supported for {{ tripleo_redhat_enforce_osp }}.

      Please make sure to pin rhel to {{ tripleo_redhat_enforce_os }} using:
      subscription-manager release --set={{ tripleo_redhat_enforce_os }}.
      You can then proceed with the update.
